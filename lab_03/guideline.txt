Introduction

The purpose of this guideline is to establish clear and effective controls over financial transactions within our organization. By prohibiting payments that exceed 1000 USD, we aim to enhance our financial oversight, mitigate risks, and ensure compliance with our internal policies and external regulatory requirements.

Scope

This guideline applies to all departments, units, and employees of the organization involved in the processing, approval, and execution of financial transactions. It encompasses all payment methods, including but not limited to cash, checks, electronic transfers, and credit card payments.

Policy Statement

No payment exceeding 1000 USD shall be processed or approved within the organization. This policy is non-negotiable and applies to all types of transactions, including but not limited to vendor payments, employee reimbursements, and operational expenses.

Exceptions

Exceptions to this policy may be granted under specific circumstances, subject to stringent review and approval processes. Exceptions may include, but are not limited to:

	1.	Emergency Expenditures: Payments necessary to address unforeseen and urgent needs critical to the organizationâ€™s operations.
	2.	Contractual Obligations: Payments required under pre-existing contracts that have been reviewed and approved by senior management.
	3.	Regulatory Requirements: Payments mandated by law or regulatory authorities.

All exceptions must be documented, justified in writing, and approved by the Chief Financial Officer (CFO) or an authorized delegate.
